**Today's Progress :** Improved my *Housing Price* prediction model in Kaggle competition from 21839.72648 to 17888.48093 score using XGBoosting, including categorical data and deriving insights from partial dependence graphs. Also learnt to write cleaner code using pipelines.

**Thoughts :** Need to find and use other models for to improve my prediction model.
