# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 0: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Improved my *Housing Price* prediction model in Kaggle competition from 21839.72648 to 17888.48093 score using XGBoosting, including categorical data and deriving insights from partial dependence graphs. Also learnt to write cleaner code using pipelines.

**Thoughts :** Need to find and use other models for to improve my prediction model.

## Day 1: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Learnt about cross-validation and data leakage(how to recognize and prevent it).

**Thoughts :** Need to find and use other models for to improve my prediction model and learn about other ML techniques.


## Day 2: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Trying to improve Deep Sort. Finally setup Yolo in google colab. Trying to use Yolo to get detection box for a video I created. I will apply these detections to modified deep sort and try to see how my code is affecting tracking.

**Thoughts :** I need a good laptop with Linux (Windows is giving me a tough time). I hope I am able to get some insights.


## Day 3: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Ran YOLO on my video to create bounding boxes.

**Thoughts :**
