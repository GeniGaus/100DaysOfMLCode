# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 0: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Improved my *Housing Price* prediction model in Kaggle competition from 21839.72648 to 17888.48093 score using XGBoosting, including categorical data and deriving insights from partial dependence graphs. Also learnt to write cleaner code using pipelines.

**Thoughts :** Need to find and use other models for to improve my prediction model.

## Day 1: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Learnt about cross-validation and data leakage(how to recognize and prevent it).

**Thoughts :** Need to find and use other models for to improve my prediction model and learn about other ML techniques.


## Day 2: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Trying to improve Deep Sort. Finally setup Yolo in google colab. Trying to use Yolo to get detection box for a video I created. I will apply these detections to modified deep sort and try to see how my code is affecting tracking.

**Thoughts :** I need a good laptop with Linux (Windows is giving me a tough time). I hope I am able to get some insights.


## Day 3: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Ran YOLO on my video to create bounding boxes.

**Thoughts :** Need to find bounding boxes in text format


## Day 3: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Began Deep Learning. Revising concepts including convolution, etc. Did some coding based on that.

**Thoughts :** Need to find bounding boxes in text format.

## Day 4: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Read Transfer Learning. Found a dataset of drivers and their locations. Going through the dataset to get some insights.

**Thoughts :** Need to find out pattern in data and create use cases


## Day 3: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress :** Implemented Transfer Learning and data augmentation, built and ran a model from scratch on MNIST fashion dataset. Used Dropout and Strides to improve performance and robustness of model. Implemented Classification of MNIST data with 98.84% validation accuracy.
